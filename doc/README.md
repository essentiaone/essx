ESS Core
=====================

Setup
---------------------
[ESS](http://essentia.one/wallet) is the original ESS client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of ESS transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more. Thankfully you only have to do this once.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run ESS on your native platform.
